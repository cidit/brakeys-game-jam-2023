today, i helped BSP to learn a bit more about rust fundamentals. we also tried to figure out how to make the mesh coliders work, but couldnt before i had to leave.
he did find this library while i was away though, and it seems quite promising <https://github.com/shnewto/bevy_rapier_collider_gen/tree/main>
