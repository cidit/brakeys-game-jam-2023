the class smells like sweat. that's extremely unpleasant.

BSP found a library last time that i explored a little bit.
this library is meant to help us generate the collision mesh for the level using the image we will use for the background. 
im not sure which function to use exactly: polyline and *convex* polyline both seem to produce the same collision mesh according to the examples.
i think today we're just going to pick one until we run into a wall. we'll try the alternatives then.
