the class smells like sweat. that's extremely unpleasant.

BSP found a library last time that i explored a little bit.
this library is meant to help us generate the collision mesh for the level using the image we will use for the background. 
im not sure which function to use exactly: polyline and *convex* polyline both seem to produce the same collision mesh according to the examples.
i think today we're just going to pick one until we run into a wall. we'll try the alternatives then.

---

turns out the library didnt compile when downloaded from crates.io
to go around this problem, i manually edited the `Cargo.toml` to make the entry point to the github repository of the project, and pin the commit we're using.
this worked!

---

now, we're struggling to make the collider generation work. so far, the problem isnt actually the library functions, its the loading of the image asset.

---

the problem we're having is that the image asset is not finished loading when we try to find it's collision meshes.
this means we're gonna have to introduce a state machine to make sure our code runs when the assets have finished loading.
that's a lot more code than we thought we'd need, especially this early, but it something that every game needs eventually anyways.
